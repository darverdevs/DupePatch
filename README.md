# IMPORTANT NOTICE

DupePatch is officially discontinued. I do not have time to work on this project any more, and I have lost all faith in 1.5.2 in terms of patching dupes. If somebody wishes to fork this repository and maintain it, feel free.

# DupePatch

DupePatch is a simple plugin for CraftBukkit 1.5.2 that patches a number of duplication glitches present in this ancient version of Minecraft. The dupe patches include:
- Portal minecart duplication glitch
- Chest timing TNT duplication glitch

..and hopefully more to come in the coming days and weeks. If you'd like to help us prevent duplication glitches from being used in servers, refer to our contributing guidelines.

# Contributing

- We require all contributors to use tabs rather than spaces.
- Please only submit a Pull Request if you believe you have a valid duplication glitch that can be reproduced on CraftBukkit 1.5.2.

Alternatively, if you'd like to open an issue regarding a bug with the plugin, then please refer to the Issues tab.
